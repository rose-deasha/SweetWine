# **Sweet Wines Classification Project üç∑**

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Sweet Wines Classification Project**! This project uses machine learning to classify wines as **sweet (dessert wines)** or **not sweet**, based on their physicochemical properties. By leveraging the **Wine Quality Dataset** and addressing challenges like **class imbalance**, this project delivers a robust Random Forest-based model with high accuracy.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, class imbalance handling with **SMOTE**, and detailed performance visualizations. It‚Äôs a great starting point for exploring machine learning in the food and beverage domain.

## **Features**
‚ú® **Core Highlights**:
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Explore key physicochemical properties like acidity, alcohol, and sugar.
- **SMOTE for Class Imbalance:** Effective balancing of the dataset to enhance minority class predictions.
- **Random Forest Model:** A powerful baseline for wine classification.
- **Rich Visualizations:** Gain insights through confusion matrix heatmaps, feature importance, and more.
- **Extendable Codebase:** Designed for scalability, allowing easy integration of new features or models.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains physicochemical test results and sensory quality ratings for red and white wines. It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is publicly available.

### **Details:**
- **Red Wine Dataset:** `winequality-red.csv`
- **White Wine Dataset:** `winequality-white.csv`
- **Size:** 6497 samples (1599 red wines, 4898 white wines)
- **Target Variable:** `is_sweet` (0 = Not Sweet, 1 = Sweet, derived from residual sugar)

### **Input Features:**
1. Fixed Acidity
2. Volatile Acidity
3. Citric Acid
4. **Residual Sugar** (Key indicator for sweetness)
5. Chlorides
6. Free Sulfur Dioxide
7. Total Sulfur Dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
11. Alcohol
12. **Wine Type** (Added manually: Red = 1, White = 0)

## **Visualizations**
This project includes the following visualizations to interpret model performance and data distribution:

1. **Confusion Matrix Heatmap:** Understand true vs. predicted classifications.
2. **Feature Importance Plot:** Identify the most influential features.
3. **Class Distribution Before and After SMOTE:** Observe how SMOTE balances the dataset.
4. **Precision-Recall Curve:** Assess model performance for imbalanced classes.
5. **Residual Sugar Distribution by Sweetness:** Visualize the relationship between sweetness and residual sugar.

## **Results**
- **Accuracy:** 100% on the test data.
- **Recall for Sweet Wines:** 80% after balancing with SMOTE.
- **Key Features:** Residual sugar, alcohol content, density, and wine type significantly influence sweetness prediction.

### **Performance Metrics:**
| Metric          | Class 0 (Not Sweet) | Class 1 (Sweet) |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Precision**    | 1.00               | 1.00            |
| **Recall**       | 1.00               | 0.80            |
| **F1-Score**     | 1.00               | 0.89            |

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize Random Forest using techniques like `GridSearchCV`.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate alternative models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Deploy with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
- **Data Expansion:** Include more wine varieties or external datasets for broader applicability.
- **Threshold Adjustment:** Refine the definition of sweetness for improved classification.
